                <p>Before we look at variables, we have to look at something called "comments"</p>
                <h2>Comments</h2>
                <p>A comment is something that is put in your code that won't be executed, it can be used to prevent unwanted
                    code execution or to annotate code.
                    <br>
                    There are two types of comments: single-lined and multi-lined.
                    <br>
                    Single-line comments start with "//" and end at the end of the line.

                <h2>Variables</h2>
                <p>
                    Variables are containers for storing data values. The values they store are not fixed but the type of the value is.
                    They are declared by specifying the type and the name, an optional value is provided.
                    Variable naming rules include:
                    <ol>
                        <li>English alphabets and underscores may be included anywhere.</li>
                        <li>Numbers may be included, but not the first character of the name.</li>
                        <li>Other characters are prohibited.</li>
                        <li>Variable names may not conflict with C++ keywords and existing names, they include:
                            <pre><code>for,while,do,if,else,int,short,long,double,float,bool,true,false,vector,string,array,...</code></pre>
                            and stuff that are previously declared in the program
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Variable names are case-sensitive, so "x" and "X" are different variables.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It is advised that variable names do not start with underscores, as those are commonly
                            used by internal functions and variables, e.g. <code>__x,__gcd,__gnu_pbds,__cplusplus,_GLIBCXX_IOSTREAM</code>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <h3>Common Types</h3>
                <p>For integers, we typically used <code>int</code> and <code>long long</code> 
                    that can store integer values in the range \([-2^{31},2^{31}-1(\text{equal to }2147483647)]\) and \([-2^{63}(\approx 9\cdot10^{18}),2^{63}-1]\), respectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A machine stores integers by the following manner:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Obtain binary representation of number. If number is positive, add 0 in front of it, else add 1, this added number is the sign bit.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the number is positive, store it directly.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the number is negative, flip all bits of the binary representation (except the sign bit) and add 1 to it. Store the result.
                        </li>

                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    An int uses 32 bits while a long long uses 64. You can also declare unsigned version of them by adding <code>unsigned</code> before the type. the unsigned versions, 
                    with no sign bit, are capable of extending the upper and lower bounds to twice as usual.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other integer types include <code>long</code>, which can store the same things as an <code>int</code>, and short, which uses only 16 bits.
                    <br>
                    <details>
                        <summary>Quiz: what is the range capable for a <code>short</code> to store?</summary>
                        A short can store \([-2^{15},2^{15}-1]\) which is \([-32768,32767]\).
                    </details>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Characters are stored in the <code>char</code> type, of range \([-128,127]\). There is an unsigned version.
                    They are stored by their ASCII values, a table can be found <a href="https://www.asciitable.com/">here</a>.
                    A single character can be represented by the character itself in single quotes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Real numbers (decimals) are stored in <code>float</code>, <code>double</code>, and <code>long double</code> types.
                    They do not have unsigned versions. Computers store decimals in three parts: the sign, the exponent, and the fractional part.
                    They correspond to \(\text{fractional}\cdot2^\text{exponent}\). A float uses 1 bit for sign, 8 bits for exponent, and 23 bits for fractional.
                    A double uses 1 bit for sign, 11 bits for exponent, and 52 bits for fractional.
                    As for a long double ... It depends on what type of machine you store.
                    If on a 32-bit machine, it is the same as a double. If on a x87, it occupies 80 bits. If on a 64-bit, it uses 128 bits.
                    The 80- and 128-bit version both use 15 bits for exponent. Note that the exponent can be negative, so 1 of the exponent section is actually the sign bit!

                <h2>Variable declaration</h2>
                <p>
                    A variable is like a box for data. In order to store data in the box, you need to have the box first.
                    The process of getting this box is known as declaration.
                    Declaration is in the format <code>Typename VarName</code>.

                <p>
                    Outputting a variable is just like doing so to a number. For example:
                    <pre class="cpp">
                        <code>
                            int MyAge=12;
                            cout &lt;&lt; myAge &lt;&lt; endl;
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </p>
